Our project aims to tackle the pressing issue of crime in our society by leveraging advanced technologies such as machine learning and deep learning. Crime continues to be a significant social problem, with numerous incidents occurring daily around the world, ranging from robberies to assaults and homicides.

One of the challenges in combating crime is the timely detection and response to incidents, especially in cases where law enforcement may not be immediately aware or present at the scene. To address this issue, our project focuses on the detection and analysis of human screams, which often accompany violent crimes such as assaults or robberies.

Using machine learning and deep learning algorithms, we have developed a system capable of recognizing and analyzing human screams in real-time. Upon detecting a scream, the system triggers an alert mechanism, which notifies the nearest police station officers about the incident. This alert is sent via SMS (Short Messaging Service) and includes the location of the crime scene, enabling officers to respond promptly and effectively.

By providing law enforcement with timely information and location details, our project aims to enhance their ability to prevent and address crimes swiftly. Ultimately, we hope that our initiative will contribute to reducing crime rates and creating safer communities for everyone
